<p>The Huracán has various interior options for more comfort inside the car. It has a choice for full electric control and heating of the sport seats in addition to the standard lengthwise alignment and electric backrest. The car also has an optional navigation system and leather upholstering. The Huracán is one of the first sports cars moving the infotainment system out of the center stack: Lamborghini Infotainment System.

It is the first Lamborghini automobile to use the 12.3 inch TFT virtual cockpit from parent company Audi, which is available with high-definition (1440 x 540) 3D computer graphics, Bluetooth, Google Earth GPS navigation and Multi Media Interface-like menu and dashboard controls, all powered by Nvidia Tegra 3.
